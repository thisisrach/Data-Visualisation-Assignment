When I returned from [my first duty station] in Germany, I separated from the Air Force for about nine months, but I missed it so much, I was like, 'Well, I guess I could join the reserves.\" I did want to get my education. I was ready by then.\n",

      "“So, I enrolled in school and went into the Reserves, and then 9/11 happened. That will change a person. I called my unit that afternoon and said, \"Whatever you need, I'm ready.\" I was activated supporting the mission, but I didn't deploy like my husband. [9/11] is what touched my life more than anything: how quickly things can change in the blink of an eye. That's what strengthened my respect of the Air Force core values: service before self and integrity, and excellence in all we do.\n",

      "“Then, when I got pregnant, I thought I might want to be home, so I continued in civil service and just fell in love with my kids. That's when my relationship with loving the Air Force changed. It evolved. I still value all that time I had and served and the lessons I learned growing up [in the Air Force]. The biggest thing I have and will continue to pass on to my kids is respect for your country, even if you don't follow the route I did. Respect your country and the people who serve it.” – Tami Wisniewski, Management and Program Analyst, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center \n",
